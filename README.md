## Taking Notes While Reading

There are three steps to effectively taking notes while reading:

1. At the end of each chapter write a few bullet points that summarize what you've read and make it personal if you can â€” that is, apply it to something in your life. Also note any unanswered questions. When you're done the book, put it down for a week.

2. Pick up the book again and go through all your notes. Most of these will be garbage but there will be lots you want to remember. Write the good stuff on the inside cover of the book along with a page number.

3. Copy out the excerpts by hand or take a picture of them to pop into Evernote. Tag accordingly.
