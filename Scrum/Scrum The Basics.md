# Scrum The Basics

Scrum is a set of simple **processes and practices** that can help you harness the speed of change. 
- On a project team, the goal is to get the project "Done". 
- In real life, project work is completely unpredictable.
- Agile project management allows a team to adapt to change in real-time. ( => the agile manifesto)
- Scrum allows team to deliver milestones as small pieces.
 
Software development is "Empirical Work". You try something, check the results and if it did not work, you try something else.
 
## The Agile Manifesto
 
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### A new set of project management and software development methodologies
- work with business partners throughout a project
- measure success using completed software
- allow teams to self-organize

## Scrum Framework

- Product owner prioritizes a backlog of work.
- Team decides what work can be done next.
- Team develops and tests solutions until done.
- Team demonstrates its completed work.
- Team reflects on how it can improve.

### Key Scrum Roles

- Product Owner
  - Focuses on **what needs to be done**
  - Business representative dedicated 100% to the team
  - Reviews the team's work (accept or reject)
  - Ensures the highest value is delivered
  - Interacts with stakeholders
  - Maintains the product vision
  
- Scrum Master
  - Focuses on **how the team does the work**
  - Dedicated role that protects the team and protects the processes
  - Balances the demands of the PO against the needs of the team
  - Keeps the team working at a sustainable pace
  - Acts as a spokesperson for the team
  - Helps remove any roadblocks for the team
  - Holds the team accountable to the product owner (show trends over time)
  - Helps them improve
  
### Key Elements

- Teams deliver products every 2-4 weeks
- Team meeting held each day (Daily Stand-up or Daily Scrum)
- Meeting for the team to reflect on how to improve (Retrospective)

### Scrum Team
- Make sure you have a dedicated team
- Ideal size: 7 +/- 2 members 
  - (that's 5-9 people who have all the skills to complete the work)
- Co-locate your team in the same area (video conferencing, chat, phones)
- Dealing with conflicts
  - establish team norms early
  - working relationships
  - conflict resolution
  - consensus options
  
## Getting ready to work

**Product Vision** serves as a guid for your team. It's established by the Product Owner before work begins.

Minimum Viable Product (just enough to get user feedback)
- allows for a fast feedback loop
- reduces scope creep
  
User Story 
- detailed, valuable chunk of work a team can quickly deliver
- usually written by the Product Owner
- independent, negociable, valuable, estimable, small, testable
- format: `As a <user role>, I want <user requirement> so that <desired benefit>`.
- AC (acceptance criteria for the story)
- user stories for the "Product Backlog"

Set boundries for success
- definiton of "Done"
- examples (it has to be tested, it has to be code reviewed and errors have to be fixed)
- backlog grooming (value of stories, most valuable delivered first)
- establish sprint duration (or cadence), recommended two weeks

Story points and estimation
- actual estimating
- relative estimating (comparing things (user stories) to eachother)
- a relative estimate is not a commitment
- when is time to do the work we need to be specific
- story points are units of measure

Create a roadmap and release plan
- Roadmap (guide showing when themes will be worked on during a time frame)
- Release Plan (provides visibility on how are we going to deliver)
- Stabilized Velocity (team knows how many story points can complete in each sprint)

## Sprint Planning

- Developers
- Scrum Master
- Product Owner

Using the prioritized backlog, the PO presents the highest value stories.
- the team asks questions
- post the team's definition of "Done"
- at the end of meeting the team is going to commit
- everyone has a clarity on the story
- team writes down the tasks needed
- each task should be clear and estimated
- verify that the team has the capacity

Information Radiators (track your team progress)
- Project vision
- Team norms
- Team's definition of done
- Roadmap
- Release plan

The taks board (not started, in progress, done)
- shows the stories
- tasks in current status
- completed tasks

Sprint Burndown Chart
- measures sprint execution
- team's capacity
- completed work

Daily Scrum
- established by the Scrum Master
- collaboration, communication, cadence
- includes everbody on the team
- daily (non negotiable)
- in front of the task board
- limited to 15 minutes (it can be shorter but not longer)
- everbody has to stand up
- what you did yesterday, what are you going to do today, is anything blocking you
- daily opportunity to ask for help
- the whole team can help to solve impediments

Backlog grooming
- keeping the right priorities
- PO meeting with stakeholders
- backlog constantly changes (PO works on details and AC)
- 30 to 60 minutes, occurs at the mid-point of the sprint
- questions by the team, answers by the PO
- the PO can only add stories to future sprints (not to the current one)
- helps the PO to know where there are gaps in the requirements

## Wrapping up a sprint

Acceptance Criteria (AC)
- approval comes from the PO
- accept or reject
- accepted stories move to "Done"

Sprint Review
- when the team reviews the sprint
- unaccepted or incomplete work is reviewed, prioritized and moved to another sprint
- in some cases stories need to be split into smaller ones
- the team agrees on what is done and ready to show to other stakeholders

Demo the team's work
- whatever PO accepted is ready to demo
- how the PO and team make sure the stakeholders are happy
- direct conversation with the stakeholders (direct feedback)
- suggestions for changes (new stories for the backlog)
- build relationship (stakeholders know who is working on their product)
- shows the overall progress
- hold demos as often as possible

Assess the team (the Retrospective)
- the team need to reflect on how to be more effective
- focuses on team performance at the end of each sprint
- the focus is not on the product, it's on the team
- closed doors session (only team members present)
- what worked well?
- what did not worked well?
- what can be improved?
