# Scrum

Scrum (n): A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

Scrum is:
- Lightweight
- Simple to understand
- Difficult to master

## The Scrum Guide

## Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation

Scrum users must **frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal** to detect undesirable variances. Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work.

Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation, as described in the Scrum Events section of this document:
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

## The Scrum Team
- a Product Owner
- the Development Team
- a Scrum Master

### The Product Owner

The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team.

The Product Owner is **the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog**. Product Backlog management includes:
- Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;
- Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
- Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and,
- Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.

The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the Product Owner remains accountable.

### The Development Team

The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. A "Done" increment is required at the Sprint Review. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.

Development Teams have the following characteristics:
- They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;
- Development Teams are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment;
- Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being performed by the person;
- Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of domains that need to be addressed like testing, architecture, operations, or business analysis; and,
- Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.

### The Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.

**Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner**
- Ensuring that goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the Scrum Team as well as possible;
- Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management;
- Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;
- Understanding product planning in an empirical environment;
- Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value;
- Understanding and practicing agility; and,
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.

**Scrum Master Service to the Development Team**
- Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality;
- Helping the Development Team to create high-value products;
- Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress;
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed; and,
- Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.

**Scrum Master Service to the Organization**
- Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;
- Planning Scrum implementations within the organization;
- Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development;
- Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team; and,
- Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization.

## Scrum Events
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

### The Sprint
The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a **time-box of one month or less** during which a "Done", useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

Sprints contain and consist of the 
- Sprint Planning, 
- Daily Scrums, 
- the development work, 
- the Sprint Review, and 
- the Sprint Retrospective

Each Sprint has a goal of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work, and the resultant product increment.

During the Sprint:
- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
- Quality goals do not decrease; and,
- Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

### Cancelling a Sprint

Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint, although he or she may do so under influence from the stakeholders, the Development Team, or the Scrum Master.

A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. This might occur if the company changes direction or if market or technology conditions change.

When a Sprint is cancelled, any completed and "Done" Product Backlog items are reviewed. If part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it. All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog.

### Sprint Planning

The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

**Sprint Planning answers the following:**
- What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
- How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

**What can be done this Sprint?**
- The Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. 
- The Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal. 

The input to this meeting is 
- the Product Backlog, 
- the latest product Increment, 
- projected capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint, and 
- past performance of the Development Team. 

The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the Development Team. Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint.

**How will the chosen work get done?**

Having set the Sprint Goal and selected the Product Backlog items for the Sprint, the Development Team decides how it will build this functionality into a "Done" product Increment during the Sprint. 

The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog.

- The Product Owner can help to clarify the selected Product Backlog items and make trade-offs. 
- If the Development Team determines it has too much or too little work, it may renegotiate the selected Product Backlog items with the Product Owner. 
- The Development Team may also invite other people to attend to provide technical or domain advice.

**Sprint Goal**
- The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. 
- It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. 
- It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting.

### Daily Scrum

- The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint at the same time and place to reduce complexity
- The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team 
- inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and progress toward the Sprint Goal
- the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours

The structure of the meeting is set by the Development Team and can be conducted in different ways if it focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal. Here is an example of what might be used:
- What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
- What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
- Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

The Development Team or team members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for detailed discussions, or to adapt, or replan, the rest of the Sprint’s work.

The Daily Scrum is an internal meeting for the Development Team. If others are present, the Scrum Master ensures that they do not disrupt the meeting.
