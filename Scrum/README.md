## Inspection and Adaptation

Scrum users must **frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal** to detect undesirable variances. Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work.

Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation, as described in the Scrum Events section of this document:
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective
