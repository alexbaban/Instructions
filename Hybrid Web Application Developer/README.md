# Application for Hybrid Web Application Developer

Thank you for following the link here.

## Most recent personal project

Four days ago I wrote a short post about how to build an application which can be used to send text messages from a desktop computer to mobile phones. It's simple but it's practical and it demonstrates how I was able to:
- find a compiler to produce cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux), stand-alone (portable) executables
- setting up a toolchain 
- interact with a cloud API including authentication
- understand and write code in a new language
- write instructions about how to build it

Here is a screenshot of the application (macOS):

## An interesting personal project that I designed and build (Servosafe)

Servosafe (https://www.servosafe.com) is 100% my contribution and is an automated phone-based check-in system. Workers sign in at the beginning of the shift, periodically check-in, sign off at the end of the shift. If a worker fails to check-in, Servosafe will alert the worker's supervisor.

The front-end is a website built with:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- jQuery and Bootstrap
- Moment.js and Pusher.com

The back-end is built with:
- Virtual private server (Ubuntu Linux) from DigitalOcean
- Communication services and API from Twilio
- OpenBD (ColdFusion server) and Node.js (for Pusher.com interaction)

The source code is private but I'm willing to show it at an interview, here are some screenshots of the web interface:

- dashboard

- activity

- add user
