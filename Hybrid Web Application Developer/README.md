# Application for Hybrid Web Application Developer

Thank you for following the link here.

Four days ago I wrote a short post about how to build a desktop application which can be used to send text messages to mobile phones. It's simple but it's useful and it demonstrates how I was able to:

- setting up a toolchain 
- interact with a cloud API including authentication
- understand and write code in a new language
- write instructions about how to build it

Here is a screenshot of the program
