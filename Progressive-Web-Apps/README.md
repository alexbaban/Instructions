# Progressive-Web-Apps-Reference

## Intro

Progressive web apps start off as simple websites, but as the user engages with them, they transform into something much more like a traditional, native app.

### Benefits
* Availability regardless of connection
* Fast loading times (using service workers)
* Push notifications (native feel)
* Homescreen shortcut (the browser will automatically suggest to the user to add a shortcut)
* Native look (splash screen, launch in full-screen mode, lock screen orientation, etc...)
* Reach new audiences (Windows Mobile and Amazon Fire)

### At the heart of every progressive web app is **the service worker**

This means that there is a layer between the page and the web that can respond to requests independently of a network connection. Service workers are simply JavaScript files (code).

Service workers and the associated web technologies allow us to write web apps with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, apps that can truly compete with native mobile apps.
